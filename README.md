# Software Engineering 2 Project

### What is this?

This repository contains the deliverables for the *Software Engineering 2* course project.
The goal was to develop a [Requirements and Specification Document (RASD)](DeliveryFolder/RASDv1.pdf) and a [Design Document (DD)](DeliveryFolder/DDv1.pdf) for *Student&Companies (S&C)*, a web application designed to connect students and companies. The platform allows companies to post internship opportunities and students to browse and apply for them.  

The project involved:  
- Defining system requirements and use cases  
- Designing the software architecture  
- Specifying detailed design choices following software engineering best practices
