Online coding challenges and platforms have become an essential resource for programmers and developers in the modern tech landscape. These platforms provide a versatile means to enhance coding skills, offer practical learning experiences, and promote a competitive and engaging approach to problem-solving. Additionally, participation in such platforms can prepare individuals for tech industry job interviews, as many companies utilize similar coding challenges during their recruitment processes.\\
Indeed, online coding challenge platforms are proving to be invaluable tools. They not only facilitate skill development and community engagement, but also foster professional growth in the continuously evolving field of programming.

What makes the CodeKataBattle platform even more compelling is the involvement of experienced Educators who create coding Battles. These experts design challenges that are not only instructive but also thought-provoking, ensuring a rich and educational experience for participants.

Moreover, these platforms often facilitate the creation of groups, enabling collaborative problem-solving and enhancing team working skills. Users can form teams, tackle challenges together, and learn from one another's approaches. This group dynamic adds an extra layer of motivation and shared learning experiences, enhancing the value of these platforms for participants.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}%
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a new platform that aims to help Students to improve their software development skills by participating in Tournaments and Battles, in which they will train on code katas, programming exercises that contain some test cases to be passed. Educators will create Tournaments and Battles in order to challenge the Students that will be asked to create groups and compete with their code.
