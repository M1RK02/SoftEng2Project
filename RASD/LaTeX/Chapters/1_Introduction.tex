Today, enriching our CVs to give us more opportunities in the job world became a very important challenge. 
Fortunately, many universities have contact with several companies that offer students many opportunities to join internships.
This platform facilitates the contact between companies that need students for internships and students interested in enriching their CVs.

S\&C not only connects the two sides, it also helps them to become attractive to each other, providing advice: to students during the registration and upload of their CVs, to the companies during the process of publishing internships.

Moreover S\&C provides a recommendation service that advertises internships to potentially interested students, and notifies companies about the availability of students CVs corresponding to their needs.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}%
In the S\&C platform, there are three main participants: students, companies, and universities.

Students can register on the platform by filling in some questionnaires and uploading their CVs. 

Companies can publish new internships with the corresponding information about domain, topics, technologies adopted ecc.

Students can apply for internships.

The university monitors the situation of internships to handle complaints.
