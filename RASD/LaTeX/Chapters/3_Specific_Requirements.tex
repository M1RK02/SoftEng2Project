This section is devoted to a specific description of every kind of requirement the system has to deal with in order to achieve all the functionalities described.


\section{External interface requirements}
\label{sec:external_interface_requirements}%

\subsection{User interfaces}
\label{subsec:User_interfaces}%
The CodeKataBattle’s User interface will be a website, developed in order to be used both by STs and EDs, available to everybody who has a device with an Internet Browser and a reliable Internet connection.

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
\label{subsec:hardware_interfaces}%
The system will be accessible from every device with an Internet Browser to access the website and a reliable Internet connection.\\
The User is free to choose his device like a computer, a tablet or a smartphone, despite that, it is suggested to use a computer, which will make it easier to deal with the writing of the code.

\subsection{Software interfaces}
\label{subsec:software_interfaces}%
The system requires the GitHub APIs and the External Tools in order to work properly. Also, it will use a mailing system to send confirmation eMails to the Users during the registration process.    

\subsection{Communication interfaces}
\label{subsec:communication_interfaces}%
The communication Interfaces needed by the system are the HTTPS Protocol and the Mail System Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

\section{Performance requirements}
\label{sec:performance_requirements}%
\paragraph{Number of concurrent Users:} According to recent researches, websites with a similar goal of CKB, has about 1.8 million Users. We want our website to attract at least 25\% of those Users, which means CKB should be able to handle up to 500,000 Users simultaneously. This is important for making sure our website works well for a good number of people, giving them a smooth and enjoyable experience.
\paragraph{Data storage:} CKB needs to save and manage all the details about both STs and EDs. Additionally, it has to store information about all the Tournaments, including the associated Battles. When a Tournament is closed all the data about it won’t be canceled and a reference of it and of the Battles remains in the ED’s page .
\paragraph{Time response:} Every operation that is directly executed by CKB, i.e. register, login, create, join and evaluate, should be in the domain of milliseconds. Other operations such as the ones that involve GH, the mailing system and the External Tools cannot be guaranteed by CKB itself.

\section{Design constraints}
\label{sec:design_constraints}%


\subsection{Standard compliance}
\label{subsec:standard compliance}%%
The system must be compliant to the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), a set of regulations that is designed in order to protect the personal data, the privacy and security of the EU's citizens. 


\subsection{Hardware limitations}
\label{subsec:hardware_limitations}%
The only hardware limitations are the support for a reliable internet connection and for a Web Browser.


\section{Software system attributes}
\label{sec:software_system_attributes}%

\subsection{Reliability}
\label{subsec:reliability}%
The system has to be fault tolerant in order to prevent the propagation of errors and to guarantee a continuous usability of the system.

\subsection{Availability}
\label{subsec:availability}%
The system must be available the most time possible, with a minimum value of 99.9\% (three-nines) of time. In this way the system will be unavailable for only 8.76 hours a year. \\
It shall be prevented a case scenario in which a maintenance break occurs near to Battle's end, therefore there must be as few maintenance breaks as possible, with them possibly at nightime.

\subsection{Security}
\label{subsec:security}%
The system must control the access rights of the Users. The system shall grant both authentication, verifying the identity of the Users that attempt to login and authorization, verifying the permission of the already logged Users to perform certain requested actions. \\
Measures to protect the database will be adopted, such as defense against query injections, and password and Users' personal data stored will be encrypted.


\subsection{Maintainability}
\label{subsec:maintainability}%
The system must be designed using scalable and reusable models in order to permit future addition of features with minimum effort. \\
Ordinary maintenance has to be scheduled at nightime, in order to keep the services available when the User traffic is high.

\subsection{Portability}
\label{subsec:portability}%
The system must be accessible by the Users from every kind of Web Browser.\\ 
There are no particular portability requirements server side.
