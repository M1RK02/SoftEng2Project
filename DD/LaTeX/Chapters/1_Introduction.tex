\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%
The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of CodeKataBattle.
It is addressed to the developers who have to implement the requirements and could be used as an agreement between the customer and the contractors.\\ 
The document is also intended to provide the customer with a clear and unambiguous description of the system's functionalities and constraints, allowing the customer to validate the requirements and to verify if the system meets the expectations.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}%
CodeKataBattle (CKB) is a new platform that aims to help Students to improve their software development skills by participating in Tournaments and Battles, in which they will train on code katas, programming exercises that contain some test cases to be passed. Educators will create Tournaments and Battles in order to challenge the Students that will be asked to create groups and compete with their code.
